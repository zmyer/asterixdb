   GLYPHICONS Halflings font is also released as an extension of a Bootstrap
   (www.getbootstrap.com) for free and it is released under the same license as
   Bootstrap. While you are not required to include attribution on your
   Bootstrap-based projects, I would certainly appreciate any form of support,
   even a nice Tweet is enough. Of course if you want, you can say thank you and
   support me by buying more icons on GLYPHICONS.com.
