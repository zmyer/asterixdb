When writing a complex SQL++ query, it can sometimes be helpful to define one or more auxilliary functions
that each address a sub-piece of the overall query.
The declare function statement supports the creation of such helper functions.
In general, the function body (expression) can be any legal SQL++ query expression.

    FunctionDeclaration  ::= "DECLARE" "FUNCTION" Identifier ParameterList "{" Expression "}"
    ParameterList        ::= "(" ( <VARIABLE> ( "," <VARIABLE> )* )? ")"

The following is a simple example of a temporary SQL++ function definition and its use.

##### Example

    DECLARE FUNCTION friendInfo(userId) {
        (SELECT u.id, u.name, len(u.friendIds) AS friendCount
         FROM GleambookUsers u
         WHERE u.id = userId)[0]
     };

    SELECT VALUE friendInfo(2);

For our sample data set, this returns:

    [
      { "id": 2, "name": "IsbelDull", "friendCount": 2 }
    ]
