SQL++ is a highly composable expression language. Each SQL++ expression returns zero or more data model instances.
There are three major kinds of expressions in SQL++. At the topmost level, a SQL++ expression can be an
OperatorExpression (similar to a mathematical expression), an ConditionalExpression (to choose between
alternative values), or a QuantifiedExpression (which yields a boolean value). Each will be detailed as we
explore the full SQL++ grammar.

    Expression ::= OperatorExpression | CaseExpression | QuantifiedExpression

Note that in the following text, words enclosed in angle brackets denote keywords that are not case-sensitive.


## <a id="Operator_expressions">Operator Expressions</a>

Operators perform a specific operation on the input values or expressions. The syntax of an operator expression is as follows:

    OperatorExpression ::= PathExpression
                           | Operator OperatorExpression
                           | OperatorExpression Operator (OperatorExpression)?
                           | OperatorExpression <BETWEEN> OperatorExpression <AND> OperatorExpression

SQL++ provides a full set of operators that you can use within its statements. Here are the categories of operators:

* [Arithmetic Operators](#Arithmetic_operators), to perform basic mathematical operations;
* [Collection Operators](#Collection_operators), to evaluate expressions on collections or objects;
* [Comparison Operators](#Comparison_operators), to compare two expressions;
* [Logical Operators](#Logical_operators), to combine operators using Boolean logic.

The following table summarizes the precedence order (from higher to lower) of the major unary and binary operators:

| Operator                                                                    | Operation |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| EXISTS, NOT EXISTS                                                          |  Collection emptiness testing |
| ^                                                                           |  Exponentiation  |
| *, /, %                                                                     |  Multiplication, division, modulo |
| +, -                                                                        |  Addition, subtraction  |
| &#124;&#124;                                                                          |  String concatenation |
| IS NULL, IS NOT NULL, IS MISSING, IS NOT MISSING, <br/>IS UNKNOWN, IS NOT UNKNOWN, IS VALUED, IS NOT VALUED | Unknown value comparison |
| BETWEEN, NOT BETWEEN                                                        | Range comparison (inclusive on both sides) |
| =, !=, <>, <, >, <=, >=, LIKE, NOT LIKE, IN, NOT IN                             | Comparison  |
| NOT                                                                         | Logical negation |
| AND                                                                         | Conjunction |
| OR                                                                          | Disjunction |

In general, if any operand evaluates to a `MISSING` value, the enclosing operator will return `MISSING`;
if none of operands evaluates to a `MISSING` value but there is an operand evaluates to a `NULL` value,
the enclosing operator will return `NULL`. However, there are a few exceptions listed in
[comparison operators](#Comparison_operators) and [logical operators](#Logical_operators).

### <a id="Arithmetic_operators">Arithmetic Operators</a>
Arithmetic operators are used to exponentiate, add, subtract, multiply, and divide numeric values, or concatenate string values.

| Operator     |  Purpose                                                                | Example    |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| +, -         |  As unary operators, they denote a <br/>positive or negative expression | SELECT VALUE -1; |
| +, -         |  As binary operators, they add or subtract                              | SELECT VALUE 1 + 2; |
| *, /, %      |  Multiply, divide, modulo                                               | SELECT VALUE 4 / 2.0; |
| ^            |  Exponentiation                                                         | SELECT VALUE 2^3;       |
| &#124;&#124; |  String concatenation                                                   | SELECT VALUE "ab"&#124;&#124;"c"&#124;&#124;"d";       |

### <a id="Collection_operators">Collection Operators</a>
Collection operators are used for membership tests (IN, NOT IN) or empty collection tests (EXISTS, NOT EXISTS).

| Operator   |  Purpose                                     | Example    |
|------------|----------------------------------------------|------------|
| IN         |  Membership test                             | SELECT * FROM ChirpMessages cm <br/>WHERE cm.user.lang IN ["en", "de"]; |
| NOT IN     |  Non-membership test                         | SELECT * FROM ChirpMessages cm <br/>WHERE cm.user.lang NOT IN ["en"]; |
| EXISTS     |  Check whether a collection is not empty     | SELECT * FROM ChirpMessages cm <br/>WHERE EXISTS cm.referredTopics; |
| NOT EXISTS |  Check whether a collection is empty         | SELECT * FROM ChirpMessages cm <br/>WHERE NOT EXISTS cm.referredTopics; |

### <a id="Comparison_operators">Comparison Operators</a>
Comparison operators are used to compare values. The comparison operators fall into one of two sub-categories: missing
value comparisons and regular value comparisons. SQL++ (and JSON) has two ways of representing missing information in
a object - the presence of the field with a NULL for its value (as in SQL), and the absence of the field (which
JSON permits). For example, the first of the following objects represents Jack, whose friend is Jill. In the other
examples, Jake is friendless a la SQL, with a friend field that is NULL, while Joe is friendless in a more natural
(for JSON) way, i.e., by not having a friend field.

##### Examples
{"name": "Jack", "friend": "Jill"}

{"name": "Jake", "friend": NULL}

{"name": "Joe"}

The following table enumerates all of SQL++'s comparison operators.

| Operator       |  Purpose                                   | Example    |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------|------------|
| IS NULL        |  Test if a value is NULL                       | SELECT * FROM ChirpMessages cm <br/>WHERE cm.user.name IS NULL; |
| IS NOT NULL    |  Test if a value is not NULL                   | SELECT * FROM ChirpMessages cm <br/>WHERE cm.user.name IS NOT NULL; |
| IS MISSING     |  Test if a value is MISSING                    | SELECT * FROM ChirpMessages cm <br/>WHERE cm.user.name IS MISSING; |
| IS NOT MISSING |  Test if a value is not MISSING                | SELECT * FROM ChirpMessages cm <br/>WHERE cm.user.name IS NOT MISSING;|
| IS UNKNOWN     |  Test if a value is NULL or MISSING            | SELECT * FROM ChirpMessages cm <br/>WHERE cm.user.name IS UNKNOWN; |
| IS NOT UNKNOWN |  Test if a value is neither NULL nor MISSING   | SELECT * FROM ChirpMessages cm <br/>WHERE cm.user.name IS NOT UNKNOWN;|
| IS VALUED      |  Test if a value is neither NULL nor MISSING   | SELECT * FROM ChirpMessages cm <br/>WHERE cm.user.name IS VALUED; |
| IS NOT VALUED  |  Test if a value is NULL or MISSING            | SELECT * FROM ChirpMessages cm <br/>WHERE cm.user.name IS NOT VALUED;|
| BETWEEN        |  Test if a value is between a start value and <br/>a end value. The comparison is inclusive <br/>to both start and end values. |  SELECT * FROM ChirpMessages cm <br/>WHERE cm.chirpId BETWEEN 10 AND 20;|
| =              |  Equality test                                 | SELECT * FROM ChirpMessages cm <br/>WHERE cm.chirpId=10; |
| !=             |  Inequality test                               | SELECT * FROM ChirpMessages cm <br/>WHERE cm.chirpId!=10;|
| <>             |  Inequality test                               | SELECT * FROM ChirpMessages cm <br/>WHERE cm.chirpId<>10;|
| <              |  Less than                                     | SELECT * FROM ChirpMessages cm <br/>WHERE cm.chirpId<10; |
| >              |  Greater than                                  | SELECT * FROM ChirpMessages cm <br/>WHERE cm.chirpId>10; |
| <=             |  Less than or equal to                         | SELECT * FROM ChirpMessages cm <br/>WHERE cm.chirpId<=10; |
| >=             |  Greater than or equal to                      | SELECT * FROM ChirpMessages cm <br/>WHERE cm.chirpId>=10; |
| LIKE           |  Test if the left side matches a<br/> pattern defined on the right<br/> side; in the pattern,  "%" matches  <br/>any string while "&#95;" matches <br/> any character. | SELECT * FROM ChirpMessages cm <br/>WHERE cm.user.name LIKE "%Giesen%";|
| NOT LIKE       |  Test if the left side does not <br/>match a pattern defined on the right<br/> side; in the pattern,  "%" matches <br/>any string while "&#95;" matches <br/> any character. | SELECT * FROM ChirpMessages cm <br/>WHERE cm.user.name NOT LIKE "%Giesen%";|

The following table summarizes how the missing value comparison operators work.

| Operator | Non-NULL/Non-MISSING value | NULL | MISSING |
|----------|----------------|------|---------|
| IS NULL  | FALSE | TRUE | MISSING |
| IS NOT NULL | TRUE | FALSE | MISSING |
| IS MISSING  | FALSE | FALSE | TRUE |
| IS NOT MISSING | TRUE | TRUE | FALSE |
| IS UNKNOWN | FALSE | TRUE | TRUE |
| IS NOT UNKNOWN | TRUE | FALSE | FALSE|
| IS VALUED | TRUE | FALSE | FALSE |
| IS NOT VALUED | FALSE | TRUE | TRUE |

### <a id="Logical_operators">Logical Operators</a>
Logical operators perform logical `NOT`, `AND`, and `OR` operations over Boolean values (`TRUE` and `FALSE`) plus `NULL` and `MISSING`.

| Operator |  Purpose                                   | Example    |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| NOT      |  Returns true if the following condition is false, otherwise returns false  | SELECT VALUE NOT TRUE;  |
| AND      |  Returns true if both branches are true, otherwise returns false            | SELECT VALUE TRUE AND FALSE; |
| OR       |  Returns true if one branch is true, otherwise returns false                | SELECT VALUE FALSE OR FALSE; |

The following table is the truth table for `AND` and `OR`.

| A  | B  | A AND B  | A OR B |
|----|----|----------|--------|
| TRUE | TRUE | TRUE | TRUE |
| TRUE | FALSE | FALSE | TRUE |
| TRUE | NULL | NULL | TRUE |
| TRUE | MISSING | MISSING | TRUE |
| FALSE | FALSE | FALSE | FALSE |
| FALSE | NULL | FALSE | NULL |
| FALSE | MISSING | FALSE | MISSING |
| NULL | NULL | NULL | NULL |
| NULL | MISSING | MISSING | NULL |
| MISSING | MISSING | MISSING | MISSING |

The following table demonstrates the results of `NOT` on all possible inputs.

| A  | NOT A |
|----|----|
| TRUE | FALSE |
| FALSE | TRUE |
| NULL | NULL |
| MISSING | MISSING |

## <a id="Case_expressions">Case Expressions</a>

    CaseExpression ::= SimpleCaseExpression | SearchedCaseExpression
    SimpleCaseExpression ::= <CASE> Expression ( <WHEN> Expression <THEN> Expression )+ ( <ELSE> Expression )? <END>
    SearchedCaseExpression ::= <CASE> ( <WHEN> Expression <THEN> Expression )+ ( <ELSE> Expression )? <END>

In a simple `CASE` expression, the query evaluator searches for the first `WHEN` ... `THEN` pair in which the `WHEN` expression is equal to the expression following `CASE` and returns the expression following `THEN`. If none of the `WHEN` ... `THEN` pairs meet this condition, and an `ELSE` branch exists, it returns the `ELSE` expression. Otherwise, `NULL` is returned.

In a searched CASE expression, the query evaluator searches from left to right until it finds a `WHEN` expression that is evaluated to `TRUE`, and then returns its corresponding `THEN` expression. If no condition is found to be `TRUE`, and an `ELSE` branch exists, it returns the `ELSE` expression. Otherwise, it returns `NULL`.

The following example illustrates the form of a case expression.
##### Example

    CASE (2 < 3) WHEN true THEN "yes" ELSE "no" END

## <a id="Quantified_expressions">Quantified Expressions</a>

    QuantifiedExpression ::= ( (<ANY>|<SOME>) | <EVERY> ) Variable <IN> Expression ( "," Variable "in" Expression )*
                             <SATISFIES> Expression (<END>)?

Quantified expressions are used for expressing existential or universal predicates involving the elements of a
collection.

The following pair of examples illustrate the use of a quantified expression to test that every (or some) element in the
set [1, 2, 3] of integers is less than three. The first example yields `FALSE` and second example yields `TRUE`.

It is useful to note that if the set were instead the empty set, the first expression would yield `TRUE` ("every" value in an
empty set satisfies the condition) while the second expression would yield `FALSE` (since there isn't "some" value, as there are
no values in the set, that satisfies the condition).

A quantified expression will return a `NULL` (or `MISSING`) if the first expression in it evaluates to `NULL` (or `MISSING`).
A type error will be raised if the first expression in a quantified expression does not return a collection.

##### Examples

    EVERY x IN [ 1, 2, 3 ] SATISFIES x < 3
    SOME x IN [ 1, 2, 3 ] SATISFIES x < 3


## <a id="Path_expressions">Path Expressions</a>

    PathExpression  ::= PrimaryExpression ( Field | Index )*
    Field           ::= "." Identifier
    Index           ::= "[" ( Expression | "?" ) "]"

Components of complex types in the data model are accessed via path expressions. Path access can be applied to the result
of a SQL++ expression that yields an instance of  a complex type, for example, a object or array instance. For objects,
path access is based on field names. For arrays, path access is based on (zero-based) array-style indexing.
SQL++ also supports an "I'm feeling lucky" style index accessor, [?], for selecting an arbitrary element from an array.
Attempts to access non-existent fields or out-of-bound array elements produce the special value `MISSING`.
Type errors will be raised for inappropriate use of a path expression, such as applying a field
accessor to a numeric value.

The following examples illustrate field access for a object, index-based element access for an array, and also a
composition thereof.

##### Examples

    ({"name": "MyABCs", "array": [ "a", "b", "c"]}).array

    (["a", "b", "c"])[2]

    ({"name": "MyABCs", "array": [ "a", "b", "c"]}).array[2]


## <a id="Primary_expressions">Primary Expressions</a>

    PrimaryExpr ::= Literal
                  | VariableReference
                  | ParenthesizedExpression
                  | FunctionCallExpression
                  | Constructor

The most basic building block for any SQL++ expression is PrimaryExpression. This can be a simple literal (constant)
value, a reference to a query variable that is in scope, a parenthesized expression, a function call, or a newly
constructed instance of the data model (such as a newly constructed object, array, or multiset of data model instances).

## <a id="Literals">Literals</a>

    IntegerLiteral ::= <DIGITS>
    <DIGITS>       ::= ["0" - "9"]+
    FloatLiteral   ::= <DIGITS> ( "f" | "F" )
                     | <DIGITS> ( "." <DIGITS> ( "f" | "F" ) )?

    DoubleLiteral  ::= <DIGITS> "." <DIGITS>
                       | "." <DIGITS>

Literals (constants) in SQL++ can be strings, integers, floating point values, double values, boolean constants, or special constant values like `NULL` and `MISSING`. The `NULL` value is like a `NULL` in SQL; it is used to represent an unknown field value. The specialy value `MISSING` is only meaningful in the context of SQL++ field accesses; it occurs when the accessed field simply does not exist at all in a object being accessed.

The following are some simple examples of SQL++ literals.

##### Examples

    'a string'
    "test string"
    42

Different from standard SQL, double quotes play the same role as single quotes and may be used for string literals in SQL++.

### <a id="Variable_references">Variable References</a>

    VariableReference     ::= <IDENTIFIER>|<DelimitedIdentifier>
    <IDENTIFIER>          ::= <LETTER> (<LETTER> | <DIGIT> | "_" | "$")*
    <LETTER>              ::= ["A" - "Z", "a" - "z"]
    DelimitedIdentifier   ::= "`" (<EscapeQuot>
                                    | <EscapeBslash>
                                    | <EscapeSlash>
                                    | <EscapeBspace>
                                    | <EscapeFormf>
                                    | <EscapeNl>
                                    | <EscapeCr>
                                    | <EscapeTab>
                                    | ~["`","\\"])*
                              "`"

A variable in SQL++ can be bound to any legal data model value. A variable reference refers to the value to which an in-scope variable is
bound. (E.g., a variable binding may originate from one of the `FROM`, `WITH` or `LET` clauses of a `SELECT` statement or from an
input parameter in the context of a function body.) Backticks, for example, \`id\`, are used for delimited identifiers. Delimiting is needed when
a variable's desired name clashes with a SQL++ keyword or includes characters not allowed in regular identifiers.

##### Examples

    tweet
    id
    `SELECT`
    `my-function`

### <a id="Parenthesized_expressions">Parenthesized Expressions</a>

    ParenthesizedExpression ::= "(" Expression ")" | Subquery

An expression can be parenthesized to control the precedence order or otherwise clarify a query. In SQL++, for composability, a subquery is also an parenthesized expression.

The following expression evaluates to the value 2.

##### Example

    ( 1 + 1 )

### <a id="Function_call_expressions">Function Call Expressions</a>

    FunctionCallExpression ::= FunctionName "(" ( Expression ( "," Expression )* )? ")"

Functions are included in SQL++, like most languages, as a way to package useful functionality or to componentize complicated or reusable SQL++ computations. A function call is a legal SQL++ query expression that represents the value resulting from the evaluation of its body expression with the given parameter bindings; the parameter value bindings can themselves be any SQL++ expressions.

The following example is a (built-in) function call expression whose value is 8.

##### Example

    length('a string')


### <a id="Constructors">Constructors</a>

    Constructor              ::= ArrayConstructor | MultisetConstructor | ObjectConstructor

A major feature of SQL++ is its ability to construct new data model instances. This is accomplished using
its constructors for each of the model's complex object structures, namely arrays, multisets, and objects.
Arrays are like JSON arrays, while multisets have bag semantics.
Objects are built from fields that are field-name/field-value pairs, again like JSON.

The following examples illustrate how to construct a new array with 4 items and a new object with 2 fields respectively.
Array elements can be homogeneous (as in the first example),
which is the common case, or they may be heterogeneous (as in the second example). The data values and field name values
used to construct arrays, multisets, and objects in constructors are all simply SQL++ expressions. Thus, the collection
elements, field names, and field values used in constructors can be simple literals or they can come from query variable
references or even arbitrarily complex SQL++ expressions (subqueries).
Type errors will be raised if the field names in an object are not strings, and
duplicate field errors will be raised if they are not distinct.

##### Examples

    [ 'a', 'b', 'c', 'c' ]

    [ 42, "forty-two!", { "rank" : "Captain", "name": "America" }, 3.14159 ]

    {
      'project name': 'Hyracks',
      'project members': [ 'vinayakb', 'dtabass', 'chenli', 'tsotras', 'tillw' ]
    }
